        ? <>As we covered earlier, using gray text is an effective way to de-emphasize content on a white background. 
        However, this technique doesn&apos;t translate as well to <b>colored backgrounds</b>.<br /><br />Why? Because gray 
        text typically has <b>reduced contrast</b> against colored surfaces, which can make it harder to readâ€”even when 
        you&apos;re intentionally trying to downplay it.
        </>
        : phase === 2
        ? <>If we switch the background to <b>white or light gray</b>, gray text works much better. The contrast is restored,
         making the text easy to read while still appearing subtle.
        </>
        : <>When placing text on a colored background, many designers default to using <b>white text with reduced opacity</b>. 
        While this does lower contrast and can help de-emphasize the text, it often results in something that looks 
        <b>dull or washed out</b>.<br /><br />Worse, if the background includes an <b>image or pattern</b>, the transparent text 
        allows too much of the background to bleed through, making it harder to read.<br /><br />A better approach 
        is to <b>manually choose a text color</b> that complements the background. Start with a version of the background 
        color itself, then reduce its <b>saturation and lightness</b> until it provides just enough contrast while still 
        blending naturally with the background. This gives you a more polished, deliberate look.
