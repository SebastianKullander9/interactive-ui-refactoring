            <h1>Designing with Grayscale</h1>
            <p>You&apos;ve finished building the functionality of your website — now it&apos;s time to design. 
            A helpful approach at this stage is to hold off on using color right away. By designing in grayscale first, 
            you&apos;re encouraged to rely on contrast, spacing, and size to create hierarchy and clarity.

            While this might feel more challenging at first, it often leads to a cleaner and more focused interface. 
            On the next screen, you’ll see a simple UI built entirely in grayscale. Before moving on, take a moment 
            to consider where you might introduce color to strengthen the visual hierarchy.

            Feel free to experiment by editing the code. Once you&apos;re ready, proceed to the next page to see how we introduced color and why.</p>
